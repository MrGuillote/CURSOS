Hi there, my name is Theodore Panagacos and I am a full-time adviser to Chief Information Security Officers (CISO).

In this course I show you exactly what a Chief Information Security Officer is and how YOU can become one in any organization.

As a career consultant who has spent nearly 20 years in the cyber security industry, I’ve been fortunate to work alongside some of the world’s top performing Chief Information Security Officers. By working with these leaders, not only did I learn first-hand how they were appointed into the role, but I quickly found I started to mentor others on improving their career too.

In this course I will show you:

- What is a CISO and where they fit within an organization's structure.
- Who they report to and what their responsibilities are.
- What skills and expertise you need to land your first role as a CISO.
- What challenges CISO's typically face in their role.
- Common traits that successful CISOs have.

Not only is this course realistic and practical, but it will help prepare and plan your career to ensure you're on the right path.

While this course will teach you how to become a CISO, it has also been designed to make you a more effective cyber security expert. This Chief Information Security Officer Master Class covers critical aspects of the CISO that will help you add immediate value to your cyber security career. Best of all, the course has been structured in an easy-to-follow format, and includes course notes so you can continue your education offline.

This course is suitable for beginners and students at all levels. You also do not need a background in Cyber Security to participate in this course.
